# AUTO_WHATSAPP_MESSAGING
The one-stop shop to sending whatsapp messages automatically so u don't have to (esp during shro !!!!!)



### Why it was built.
It's the year 2020. Coronavirus has inVADED THE EARTH and here at singapore, things seem pretty good.
While the rest of the world's struggling and dying, we're here making election memes. Life's good. Or at least not as bad as it could be.
BUT WAIT. Life's not all that great.

### INTRODUCING: SHRO.
Stay Home Rxxx Oxxx (no idea wtf RO stands for but ok). If you're an NSF Admin/Office worker, you knoW wtf this is.
Basically, the gahmen decided to force everyone to work from home so coRONAVIRUS doesn't spread.
Due to this, NSFs now have to attend roll call via whatsapp. w h a t a c h o r e. 
If you're a lazy idiot with messed up body clock like me, you might've missed your roll call mULTIPLE times. xd
Unfortunately for me I'm under fking RSM (discipline master of the camp/stn). So WEEKEND CONFINEMENT FOR YOU!!!!!!! >:(



### How does this help?
This script basically sends the roll call messages via whatsapp on whatever time your roll call is (u may change this value manually).
It is by default set at 0800 and 1400 on weekdays.
NO MORE MISSING ROLL CALL. and extra sleep for me. >;)\\\
